# Rock Paper Scissors

</div>

Rock Paper Scissors the best way for friends, family and colleagues to make decisions, as described in Wikipedia "Rock paper scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. Unlike truly random selection methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with some degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents." 

Users of this game will play one vs one against the computer, the computer will pick at random as you select a choice, the user can play as many times as they want but when they wish to reset the game they can do so by refreshing the page.
